      <p>Welcome to Mathshop! In my experience with students, it has been the case that students are able to perform computations, especially with the use of a calculator, but they face significant obstacles with applying those computations to problems that have not been set up for them. This is a much more important skill than performing the computations. Computers can compute solutions faster and more accurately than humans, but they lack the ability to examine a problem and determine what type of computation needs to be performed. That is the role I am trying to prepare students for through this website and my classes.</p>

  <p>The tools I have to work with are mathematical in nature, much like my colleagues in other departments work with science and language arts. The goal for all of us is to foster intellectual growth by having students face problems and solve them using the tools of our particular discipline. This leads to the development of critical thinking and logical reasoning which can be applied to any field upon entering the workforce. Keep in mind that the goal is not that students become mathematicians and understand the nuances of mathematical abstractions, but that they possess the skills needed to be competitive in a job market that is increasingly requiring a more educated workforce.  </p>
